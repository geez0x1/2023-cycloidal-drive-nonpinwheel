This repository contains Python code and CAD files to (re)create the cycloidal gearing designs, and experiments, from our 2024 paper
_"Experimental comparison of pinwheel and non-pinwheel designs of 3D-printed cycloidal gearing for robotics"_.

Contents:

- Python code to aid in choosing and visualising design parameters, for both pinwheel and non-pinwheel designs
- CAD files of the presented prototypes
- Python code for validation and testing using an ODrive motor controller
